## 📜 Overview

**Vantex AI** defines a new paradigm in decentralized decision-making: **Agentic Governance**. 
Built on the **Solana** blockchain, Vantex AI deploys autonomous heuristic agents to analyze, audit, and vote on SPL-Governance proposals with cryptographic precision.

> "Code is Law, but Intelligence is Sovereign."

## ⚡ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Non-Custodial Architecture** | Zero-trust model operating on sovereign non-custodial wallets. |
| **Jito Analysis Bundles** | Atomic bundling of proposal analysis and voting for MEV resistance. |
| **SendAI Integration** | Hardened AI pipelines using the Solana Agent Kit for safety and auditing. |
| **Global RPC Grid** | High-availability execution with sub-400ms latency nodes in EU and Asia. |

## 🏗️ Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + Framer Motion
- **Blockchain**: @solana/web3.js, @solana/spl-governance
- **Infrastructure**: Helius RPC, Jito Block Engine

## 🛰️ Protocol Initialization

**Vantex AI** operates as a distributed heuristic layer. To successfully integrate a DAO into the sovereign governance network, the following parameters must be analyzed:

```yaml
protocol_version: "1.0.4-agentic"
heuristic_engine: "SendAI-v2.8"
verification_method: "Ed25519-Sovereign"
latency_threshold: "<400ms"
security_layer: "Jito-Bundle-Atomic"
```

The agent logic flows through a strict **Chain-of-Thought** verification pipeline, ensuring that every governance decision is cryptographically backed by on-chain state snapshots.
